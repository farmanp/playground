# Data Structures Playground

*Visual explorations of fundamental data structures*

Interactive tools for understanding how data structures work internally - their operations, performance characteristics, and real-world applications.

## Available Playgrounds

### Hash Tables
**[Hash Map Playground](hash_playground.html)** - A comprehensive exploration of hash tables with gentle, thatgamecompany-inspired design.

**Features:**
- 4 collision strategies (chaining, linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing)
- Live visualization of hash computation and probe sequences
- Interactive challenges with validators and solutions
- Real-time performance metrics and statistics
- Accessibility-first design with audio cues and reduced motion support

**[ðŸ“– Documentation](hash_map_README.md)**

## Coming Soon

### Trees
- **Binary Search Trees** - Insertion, deletion, traversal with visual balance
- **AVL Trees** - Self-balancing with rotation animations
- **Red-Black Trees** - Color-coded balancing rules
- **B-Trees** - Multi-way trees for database indexing

### Graphs
- **Graph Representation** - Adjacency lists vs matrices
- **Traversal Algorithms** - DFS/BFS with path highlighting
- **Shortest Paths** - Dijkstra's and A* with weighted edges
- **Network Flow** - Max flow algorithms with capacity visualization

### Linear Structures
- **Dynamic Arrays** - Resizing, memory layout, amortized analysis
- **Linked Lists** - Singly, doubly, circular with pointer visualization
- **Stacks & Queues** - LIFO/FIFO operations with call stack examples
- **Deques** - Double-ended queues with efficient operations

### Advanced Structures
- **Heaps** - Min/max heaps with heapify animations
- **Disjoint Sets** - Union-find with path compression
- **Segment Trees** - Range queries with lazy propagation
- **Tries** - Prefix trees for string operations

## Design Philosophy

Each data structure playground emphasizes:

- **Internal Mechanics**: See how operations work step-by-step
- **Performance Impact**: Visualize time/space complexity in action
- **Real-world Context**: Connect abstract concepts to practical applications
- **Interactive Exploration**: Learn through experimentation, not memorization
- **Beautiful Aesthetics**: Make data structures approachable and engaging

## Educational Approach

1. **Start Simple**: Basic operations before advanced features
2. **Build Intuition**: Visual metaphors for abstract concepts
3. **Show Trade-offs**: Compare different approaches side-by-side
4. **Practice Application**: Challenges that demonstrate real usage
5. **Celebrate Understanding**: Gentle feedback and progress indicators

## Technical Standards

- Single HTML file per playground (no build dependencies)
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Smooth animations with reduced motion options
- Consistent color palette and interaction patterns
