# System Design Playground

*Interactive exploration of distributed systems and scalable architectures*

Visual tools for understanding how large-scale systems are designed, how components interact, and how to make architectural trade-offs.

## Coming Soon

### Core Concepts
- **Scalability Patterns** - Horizontal vs vertical scaling visualizations
- **Load Balancing** - Round-robin, least connections, consistent hashing
- **Caching Strategies** - L1/L2/CDN with cache hit/miss animations
- **Database Patterns** - ACID properties, CAP theorem, consistency models

### Distributed Systems
- **Microservices Architecture** - Service boundaries and communication patterns
- **Message Queues** - Producer/consumer patterns with different queue types
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Event sourcing and CQRS patterns
- **Service Discovery** - How services find and communicate with each other

### Data Management
- **Database Sharding** - Horizontal partitioning strategies
- **Replication Patterns** - Master-slave, master-master configurations
- **Consistency Models** - Strong, eventual, causal consistency
- **Data Pipelines** - ETL processes and streaming architectures

### Performance & Reliability
- **Circuit Breakers** - Failure isolation and recovery patterns
- **Rate Limiting** - Token bucket, sliding window algorithms
- **Monitoring & Observability** - Metrics, logs, traces visualization
- **Disaster Recovery** - Backup strategies and failover mechanisms

### Real-World Systems
- **Social Media Platform** - Feed generation, user graphs, content delivery
- **E-commerce System** - Inventory, payments, order processing
- **Video Streaming** - Content delivery, adaptive bitrate, global distribution
- **Chat Application** - Real-time messaging, presence, scaling connections

## Design Philosophy

Each system design playground will emphasize:

- **Interactive Diagrams**: Click to explore component interactions
- **Trade-off Visualization**: See the impact of architectural decisions
- **Scalability Simulation**: Watch systems handle increasing load
- **Failure Scenarios**: Understand how systems degrade and recover
- **Real-world Context**: Connect patterns to actual system requirements

## Educational Approach

1. **Start with Problems**: Real business needs drive design decisions
2. **Show Trade-offs**: Every choice has consequences
3. **Scale Progressively**: Begin simple, add complexity gradually
4. **Failure-Aware**: Design for failure from the beginning
5. **Measure Everything**: Metrics guide optimization decisions

## Interactive Features

### **System Builder**
- Drag-and-drop components to build architectures
- Real-time capacity and latency calculations
- Cost estimation for cloud deployments
- Bottleneck identification and suggestions

### **Load Simulator**
- Generate realistic traffic patterns
- Observe system behavior under stress
- Identify failure points and capacity limits
- Test disaster recovery scenarios

### **Architecture Analyzer**
- Input existing system designs
- Get recommendations for improvements
- Compare different architectural approaches
- Estimate operational complexity

## Planned Playgrounds

### **Microservices Designer**
Interactive tool for designing service boundaries, API contracts, and communication patterns.

### **Database Architect**
Choose between SQL/NoSQL, design schemas, plan for scale and consistency requirements.

### **Cache Strategy Planner**
Design multi-layer caching with different eviction policies and consistency guarantees.

### **Message Queue Explorer**
Compare different messaging patterns, delivery guarantees, and ordering semantics.

### **Load Balancer Simulator**
Test different algorithms with realistic traffic patterns and server failures.

### **CDN Optimizer**
Plan global content distribution with edge locations and cache hierarchies.

## Technical Implementation

- **Interactive SVG Diagrams**: Scalable, responsive system diagrams
- **Real-time Simulations**: Show data flow and system states
- **Performance Modeling**: Calculate throughput and latency
- **Cost Estimation**: Integration with cloud pricing APIs
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate documentation and deployment configs

## Learning Outcomes

After using these playgrounds, you'll understand:

- How to design systems that scale to millions of users
- When to choose different architectural patterns
- How to plan for failure and build resilient systems
- Trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance
- Operational concerns like monitoring, deployment, and maintenance
